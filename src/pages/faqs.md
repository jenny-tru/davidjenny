## What should I wear?

We’re so glad you asked - but really, whatever you feel your happiest self in! Our dress code is formal attire for the wedding so ladies - warm autumn tones for dresses and gentlemen - suit and tie is reccommended.

For the casual welcome dinner, you may have just had a travel day so anything slightly above casual would be perfect.

_If you have any questions, fit pics or concerns - please reach out to Jenny or David._

## Will the ceremony and reception be outdoors? What’s the weather?

Both the ceremony and reception are indoors.
We can’t stress enough that this area sees a wide range of weather from rain to sunshine in minutes. Novmeber swings from 73°F / 63°F but please check the weather as it gets closer.

Don't forget to pack a bathing suit for the beach + pool + hot hub if it is hot enough to swim.

## Can I bring a plus one?

The wedding venue has a guest maximum, which means those who can bring a plus one will have been notified after RSVPing.

## Are children welcome?

Yes, but we ask that you keep them with you at all times. Kids bring so much joy in life and we'd love to have them dancing all night long! Plus this means parents don't have to find a baby sitter.

## Is there transportation available on the day of the wedding?

Sadly we are not able to provide transportation on the day of the wedding, but we encourage people to carpool or Lyft/Uber to the venue! If you dare to drive in Florida streets, rental cars are a great option.
