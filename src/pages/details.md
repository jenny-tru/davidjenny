## Flights

For those traveling from afar, we recommend flying into Sandford Int Airport (SFB) or Orlando Int Airport (MCO). Depending on your airport of choice, expect a drive between 15 and 30 minutes to the Clayton Family Home in Oviedo, FL.

## Food

A party without food? That's nonsense! We will have a taco tent outside serving tacos and quesadillas (for the kids) on demand. Protein options: carne asada (beef), al pastor (pork), and vegggies. There will be finger food and desserts inside.

## FAQs
_If you have any additional questions or concerns - please reach out to Jenny or David._

### What should I wear?

It's a holiday themed baby shower! Wear your favorite holiday sweater (if it's actually cold) or winter wonderland outfit and be prepared to take photos at our self served photo booth!

### Where should I park?

Parking on the property is reserved for family and those needing assistance. Please leave the driveway clear at all times. Street parking can be found throughout the neighborhood and around the cul-de-sac.

### Will you be opening gifts?

While we won't be opening gifts during the party, we would appreciate if they can be shipped to our home to make time for playing games and winning prizes!
If you want to win a lovely prize without playing games, we will have 2 raffles for those who purchase a gift from the registry, and for those who purchase diapers! Buying from the registry automatically enters you for a chance to win. For those who purchase diapers, you can enter the diaper raffle when RSVP'ing.

### Will the party be outdoors/ indoors?

We hope to have most of the activites indoors. There will be a patio and outdoor area where food will be served so find a seat or stand and enjoy celebrating the incoming baby!

### Can I bring a plus one?

It's a co-ed party so bring your partner and play our fun games to win some gift cards! Don't forget to RSVP them.

### Are children welcome to the baby shower?

Yes, but we ask that you keep an eye on them at all times since there is a pool in the backyard. List them when RSVP'ing. This means parents don't have to find a baby sitter!
